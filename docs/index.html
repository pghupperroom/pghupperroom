				<p>In 2007, then seminary students Mike Gehrling and Chris Brown committed to prayer walking in Pittsburgh. One year later, God called them to start The Upper Room in Squirrel Hill to reach people without a religious community. The church committed to being a sacramental, contemplative, and missional community to provide people with intimacy and exploration. In 2018, The Upper Room relocated to the Wilkins School Community Center in Regent Square, and in 2019, we called our new pastor, Brendan Ashley. We are committed to exploring how God is active and moving in our new neighborhood and learning to join into that reality. The Upper Room is a PCUSA missional church.</p>

				<p><b>Pastor Brendan Ashley</b> | Brendan Ashley is the Student Pastor of The Upper Room. He guides the church in worship, missional strategy, visioning, teaching, and spiritual friendship. Brendan graduated from Whitworth University (B.A. in Theology) and Pittsburgh Theological Seminary (M.Div with an emphasis in church planting). While in seminary, Brendan interned in two missional communities. His M.Div. thesis focused on a Trinitarian approach to mission for local congregations based on Charles Taylor's "A Secular Age."<br>Brendan has been married to Ashley Ashley for 8 years, and they have a sweet cat named Augustine. Brendan is an aspiring contemplative, who believes in a holistic approach to the spiritual life. This is evident in his love of watching and playing sports, reading spiritual classics and missional theology, hanging out with people, and his dedication to maintaining a rule of life.<br><br>
